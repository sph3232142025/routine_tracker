this project is under progress but am designing  it to manage the online time spent on different plartforms such as ;
tiktok,facebook,instagram,browsers and telegram along all your other platforms.
it will help you know the kind of activity you were doing online and how  much time you spend there,
ADDITIONALLY; the information of your data will be displayed as a notification on your screen after  a thorough scan  for every 24hrs,1week,one month and summary withing a year
therefore you will be able to know how much much you are productive and domant hence managing it properly; 
//not that i have used rust purely and am welcoming other developers to help me maximise it fully.
#lets matke it happen
